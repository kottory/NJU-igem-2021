      # NJU-China 2021 iGEM Team Parts

      we have used or made several parts during the whole process of our project, each of which has its own functions and features. This year's new parts were integrated with the wisdom of our team members Chenyu Tao and Xinwen Yan and they all displayed different results we expected. Here are the details of our parts, you can click the links for more information.

      | [BBa_K3756009](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K3756009) | CKLF1C19-Lamp2b-GATA3-siRNA-1 | Plasmid   | This DNA circuit is designed to express specific proteins and siRNA that specifically target TH2 cells and down-regulate the expression level of relevant target mRNA.

At the same time, the DNA circuit also expresses siRNA of GATA3, which can specifically degrade GATA3, an important transcription factor associated with type 2 inflammatory response in TH2 cells. Most importantly, the DNA circuit has attP and attB sites on both sides of the expression frame.
