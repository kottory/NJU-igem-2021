      ## Team

      Hello, we are NJU-China team from Nanjing University. This year is the 8th year of our expedition to iGEM (2013-2018; 2020-2021). NJU-China has been committed to injecting the idea of synbiology into hot fields such as energy and pharmaceutical development, and this year we are no exception. 

      We tried to reprogram lung epithelial cells to target the secretion of exosomes carrying specific siRNA, and finally treat a very common disease around us - asthma. 

      This year's team was formed in December 2020, consisting of 13 guys. 12 students from the College of life sciences and one best off-site supporter of the College of artificial intelligence are jointly responsible for project. 

      This year's team members include painting masters, Otaku, ACG lovers and Pok√©mon fans (you see nothing)... In short, we will continue to work hard this year.

      ## Acknowledgement

      From the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2021, COVID-19 is still raging around the world, and we have experienced a tortuous and unforgettable four seasons.

      Experiments grew out of nothing, constantly adjusted and failed; funds went from more to less, and experienced excitement also witnessed troughs. Fortunately, in the end, you and this team have come to the present, and the lights are still brightly lit in the lab until late at night. Thanks to every member of the team, as well as teachers, instructors and advisors, for their careful guidance. This project would not have been completed without you.

      Thanks for the funding support from M3 lab, Department of Life Science and Office of Academic Affairs of Nanjing University, who provided the laboratory and required material involved in the experiments of our project. Thank NJU Advanced Institution for Life Science and Jiangsu Engineering Center for MicroRNA Biology and Technology for the technical support. 

      Thank Yinhongyuan Community, Wutang Community, Nanjing Red Cross Organization, People's Hospital of Peking University, Zhenjiang Jingkou District People's Hospital, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University , for providing the opportunity of human practice. Thanks to students Shaobo Yang and Jichen Hao from Tsinghua University, Sifan Yang from Nanjing University and Tianyu Zhang from Fudan University for their help in modeling. Also thank the more than 300 volunteers who filled out the questionnaire. Thank GenScript and GeneChem for the opportunity to participate in the exchange and discussion, for the industrialization of the project to provide the possibility.
